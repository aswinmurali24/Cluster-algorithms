# Cluster-algorithms
This project implements and compares various clustering algorithms using the provided dataset. The algorithms evaluated are k-means, k-means++, and Bisecting k-Means, with performance measured by the Silhouette coefficient for different values of  𝑘 k. Synthetic data of the same size is also generated and clustered for comparison.
